# Product Guide

## Initial Concept
A branded, high-end implementation of the WebAuthn (FIDO2) server library, featuring a "Galaxy Macau" resort theme. The goal is to provide a polished, "real-world" authentication experience that demonstrates how FIDO2 can be integrated into luxury hospitality and service platforms.

## Target Users
*   End-users needing a streamlined and intuitive registration and login process.
*   Developers looking for a reference implementation of a modern WebAuthn interface.

## Core Goals
*   **Branded Experience:** Transform the demo into a fully themed Galaxy Macau application.
*   **Robust Backend:** Maintain the integrity and compliance of the existing PHP WebAuthn server library.
*   **Primary Entry Point:** Establish the themed login as the root `index.php` for the project.

## Key Features
*   **Mobile-First Design:** A seamless, responsive layout optimized for mobile devices and "hybrid" passkey authentication (e.g., scanning QR codes).
*   **Modern UX:** Simplified flows for registering new credentials and authenticating with existing ones.
*   **Resort Branding:** Uses the Poppins font and the gold/brown Galaxy Macau palette for a premium feel.
*   **Developer Debugging:** Integrated tools for previewing server data and managing registrations directly from the UI.
