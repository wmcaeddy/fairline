# Product Guide

## Initial Concept
A modern, user-friendly implementation of the WebAuthn (FIDO2) server library, focusing on simplifying the user experience for registration and login. The goal is to transform the functional test client into a polished, responsive authentication interface.

## Target Users
*   End-users needing a streamlined and intuitive registration and login process.
*   Developers looking for a reference implementation of a modern WebAuthn interface.

## Core Goals
*   **Refactor Client:** Transform the existing `_test` client into a modern, responsive application.
*   **Robust Backend:** Maintain the integrity and compliance of the existing PHP WebAuthn server library.
*   **Standalone Page:** Deliver a polished "Login with Passkey" page that serves as a high-quality example or integration point.

## Key Features
*   **Mobile-First Design:** A seamless, responsive layout optimized for mobile devices and "hybrid" passkey authentication (e.g., scanning QR codes).
*   **Modern UX:** Simplified flows for registering new credentials and authenticating with existing ones.
*   **Adaptive Split-Screen Layout:** A sophisticated landing page featuring a prioritized, fixed-width authentication column on the right and a fluid branding section on the left. On mobile, the authentication section is prioritized and appears on top for immediate functional access.
