# Product Guidelines

## Visual Aesthetic
*   **Brand Adaptability:** While the interface prioritizes a premium, high-fidelity experience (e.g., the professional Fairline aesthetic), it is designed for rapid themeability. This is demonstrated by its adaptation to the PChome 24h design system, utilizing a distinct red/blue palette and a dense, e-commerce-focused layout.

## Communication & Messaging
*   **Informative & Direct:** The system will provide clear, step-by-step instructions (e.g., "Insert your security key" or "Look at the camera for FaceID"). Success and failure messages will be immediate and easy to understand.

## Mobile & Cross-Device UX
*   **Universal Clarity:** The primary focus is a clean and clear user experience that translates seamlessly between workstations and mobile devices. The layout should be intuitive regardless of screen size, ensuring that registration and login tasks are easy to complete on any platform.
