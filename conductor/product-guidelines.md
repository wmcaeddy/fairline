# Product Guidelines

## Visual Aesthetic
*   **Premium & Branded:** The interface adheres to the Galaxy Macau brand guidelines, utilizing the Poppins font family and a gold/brown/black luxury color palette.

## Communication & Messaging
*   **Informative & Direct:** The system will provide clear, step-by-step instructions (e.g., "Insert your security key" or "Look at the camera for FaceID"). Success and failure messages will be immediate and easy to understand.

## Mobile & Cross-Device UX
*   **Universal Clarity:** The primary focus is a clean and clear user experience that translates seamlessly between workstations and mobile devices. The layout should be intuitive regardless of screen size, ensuring that registration and login tasks are easy to complete on any platform.
